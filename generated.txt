Once upon a time, there lived a lion in a deep forest. He was very powerful and fierce. He used to roam around the forest in search of food.

One day, while he was walking through the forest, he saw a tiny mouse. The mouse was trembling in fear and was about to run away. But the lion stopped him and said, "Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you."

The mouse was relieved to hear this and thanked the lion. The lion then asked the mouse why he was so scared. The mouse replied that he was scared because he was being chased by a hunter.

The lion was furious to hear this and decided to help the mouse. He asked the mouse to climb onto his back and he ran as fast as he could to escape the hunter.

The mouse was very thankful to the lion for saving him. As a token of his gratitude, the mouse promised to help the lion whenever he needed.

The lion smiled and said, "That's very kind of you. I may need your help someday. Until then, stay safe."

The mouse thanked the lion once again and went on his way. From that day on, the lion and the mouse became good friends. Whenever the lion was in need, the mouse would come to his rescue.

The moral of the story is that even the smallest of creatures can help the biggest of creatures when in need.
